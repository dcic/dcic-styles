## CSS
The CSS file contains various styling based on the [BD2K-LINCS DCIC webpage](http://lincs-dcic.org). It also makes use of [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to **"make browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards."** You may view the _base.scss or base.less files to see the CSS added in addition to the Normalize.css file.

You may include the dcic styles in your project by adding the link below within the `<head></head>` tags of your HTML file:
 ```HTML
 <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/dcic/dcic-styles/master/dcic.min.css">
 ```
## SASS/SCSS
If your project is using [Sass/Scss](http://sass-lang.com/), you may download the files within the sass directory of this repository and include them directly in your project.

## Less
Similarly, if you decide to use [Less](http://lesscss.org/) in your project, the files within the less directory can be downloaded and included.
