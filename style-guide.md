##Palettes
TODO: Come up with additional palettes to be used to standardize DCIC logos.

##Fonts
###Font Families
Stick to using either of the following:
- [Droid Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Sans)
- [Roboto](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto)

##Logos
Keep Icons flat: Avoid skeuomorphism. Example:

<img width="600" src="http://nodegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/skeuoflat.jpg" />

TODO: Make logos on this repo. Everyone can upload their app's logo.
  - Should be a transparent background
  - Should be square
  - Should be easy to see at 60px x 60px
